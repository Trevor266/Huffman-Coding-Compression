# Huffman-Coding-Compression
A basic implementation of a compression algorithm using Huffman Coding

This is just a little project I'm doing out of the book 
"The Data Compression Book - Second Edition", the source code is either entriely from that 
book or has been modified by me from that original source code. This is just a repo I set up 
so that I can work on this in class and at home.
